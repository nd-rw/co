**The narrow emotional graphic design goals of streetwear/high fashion**

I think the two dominant mental states I see in the designs of the current "en-vogue" brands that produce graphic-heavy items are; shock and confusion.
As Harry Giles writes in ['Shock and Care an essay about art, politics and responsibility'](https://harrygiles.org/2016/04/24/shock-and-care/): Learning how to care for your audience is actually far more aesthetically interesting and politically disruptive than working out how to shock them. 

I find "shock" to be a horrifically lazy and uninspired way to force a response. Confusion through obscure images or lines of text is also common and equally as uninspired. Pieces designed to explicitly confuse onlookers provoke a conditioned response of pride and elitism in the owner as observers will appear to "not get it".

Popular examples of shock/confusion used in fashion are:
- Anti Social Social Club and it's brash presentation of mental health issues, suicide and procrastination. All topics that general society is aware of but are still essentially taboo to talk about in public.

- Vetements: "Total Fucking Darkness", estranged oversized silhouettes.

- Supreme: Several pieces with the word "fuck" splattered across the piece.

- Undercover: Takahashi has used out-of-context song lyrics repeatedly through the years ("the wind is screaming around the trees for my psychocandy) and explicit text ("fuck the future, fuck the past").

Expanding the view to all forms of art and design, you see that artists and designers have created things that encapsulate or provoke every human emotion.

- Monstrous brutalist buildings that make you feel small and powerless as the viewer.
- Photographs of civilian causalities that provoke feelings for sympathy and sadness.
- Interior design that makes you feel comfortable.
- Music that vividly reminds you of heartbreak.
- Books that open your mind to complex philosophical perspectives.

Do graphic tees need to be limited to the most caveman-like responses of shock and confusion? Can fashion design inspire complex emotions like patience, shame and detachment? I think several designers have and are continuing to design with more nuanced and complex goals in mind and I believe it to be a more interesting and sustainable approach.

Rick Owens although occasionally criticised for his commitment to dark blacks and drapey forms has cultivated a very specific physical representation of his world through his products. Lemaire is a good example of a label that makes me feel relaxed when looking at their products while maintaining a sense of solemnity.

My fascination with the subversion of uniforms is based on how you can warp people's interpretations of you through specific pieces of clothing. The imposter-like feeling of wearing something that makes you out to be someone you are not. This feeling aligns (in a parallel way) with the unreachable goal of the "ideal-self" that many personal clothing purchases are fueled by. The desire to be someone you are not.

Looking at the breadth and depth of topics that art expresses, why is streetwear typically so one note?
