think about how paragraphs look in html formed from markdown.

Back in the Uber. Back right seat — as per usual. Driver whispers to me about how her "road rage earlier was ridonkulous". I ask her to repeat herself — partially due to her volume, mostly out of disbelief. She says it again. I'm like "Damn". Another day in paradise.
