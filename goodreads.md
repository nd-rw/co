<h2>goodreads docs, proposed pseudo-code etc</h2>


- [reviews.list api call](https://www.goodreads.com/api/index#reviews.list) to fetch list of books from shelf.

- random post idea, since I don't read books; an analysis of the books I added to my "want to read" shelf (trends, trends over time etc).
